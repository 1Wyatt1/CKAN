/*
 * How to create a new window:
 * 
 * Step 0:
 *  Don't even bother trying to make a window unless you
 *  have a lot of time to write XML and recompile every 2
 *  seconds or you're using Monodevelop
 * Step 1:
 *  Ok I assume you've gotten Monodevelop up and running
 *  (OS doesn't matter), now right click on the User Interface
 *  folder and click "New Window...", now it should open up
 *  a new dialog window asking you what GTK# file you want
 *  click on "Window", now you can name this window whatever
 *  you want, from here you just close it and open it back up
 *  so you can see the "Source" and "Designer" buttons at the
 *  bottom of the window
 * Step 2:
 *  Click on the "Designer" button/tab to open the
 *  Stetic GUI Designer
